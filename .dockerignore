# NOTE: 'dist' is NOT ignored - it must be present before Docker build
# 
# Build Architecture:
# - The dist folder is built separately (in CI/CD or locally) before Docker build
# - For local builds: run 'npm run build' before 'docker build'
# - In CI/CD: dist is built in build-and-test job and passed as artifact
# 
# Why this architecture?
# - Security: No secrets in Docker build args (secrets only used during npm build)
# - Performance: Faster Docker builds (no dependency installation in Docker)
# - Consistency: Same build process in CI/CD and local development
#
# See: .github/workflows/deploy.yml (build-and-test job)
# See: docs/LOCAL_DOCKER_BUILD.md for local build instructions
